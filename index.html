        <p>
            At night, I lie down and imagine you are here with me. I didn't know just how heavy this separation would be in my heart. I hope you are not in as much utter misery as I am without you. They say absence makes the heart grow fonder, and my fondness has
            no bounds. I lie awake and feel the gentle warmth of your breath as it would fall on my cheek. I imagine the heat of your body pressed against mine; the hardness of your muscles nestling against the softness of mine. I turn and lay my head
            against the pillow, feeling your heartbeat drum a lullaby in my ear. A thousand butterflies kiss at my skin, and I long to feel the softness of your lips. While I know we will again be together, my yearning in your absence only cements the
            true depth of my passion. Until I can see you and hold you again, you will remain omnipresent in my dreams.
